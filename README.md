This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using historical passenger data. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, cabin information, and port of embarkation, which are used to analyze factors influencing survival outcomes. The project begins with data exploration and preprocessing, where missing values are handled and categorical variables are converted into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms. After preparing the data, a supervised learning approach is applied, treating survival prediction as a binary classification problem. A Logistic Regression model is trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance. Model evaluation is conducted using accuracy and classification metrics to measure how effectively the model predicts survival. Through this project, key machine learning concepts such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are demonstrated in a practical and accessible way. The Titanic survival prediction project serves as a foundational beginner-level exercise, helping learners understand how real-world data can be transformed into actionable insights using machine learning techniques, while also highlighting the importance of data quality and thoughtful feature selection in predictive modeling.
